# Pet APi

This project was so I can learn how to create my own API using django rest framework.

[Watch demo of project which includes a preview of  the API](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1InlAU0_8LH9dxGkYJZ6QI8owbHBshFry/view?usp=sharing)

- The API manages pet data using a pet model and Django REST Framework to create and retrieve pet information. It allows filtering by pet type and page pagination.
